            <li>1 1/2 TSP Sugar</li>

            Directions
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine </strong> 1 cup flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and optional garlic powder in a large bowl</li>
            <li><strong>Add</strong> olive oil and water and use wooden spoon to stir very well</li>
            <li><strong>Gradually add</strong> another cup of flour, and any additional flour as needed, stirring until dough forms into slightly sticky but cohesive ball</li>
            <li><strong>Drizzle</strong> a seperate large bowl with olive oil, brushing it over the sides</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer </strong> your dough to the oiled bowl, making sure it is covered</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 425F while allowing dough to rise until doubled in size - about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Deflate</strong> dough and transfer to lightly floured work surface and knead for 3 - 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Work</strong> dough into a circle, pinch edge over to form a crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Poke</strong> holes in the pizza to prevent it from bubbling in the oven</li>
            <li><strong>Add</strong> desired toppings and back for 13 - 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
